### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and thanks for reading!

In between studying, I code by day, and I game or take photos at night (or draw, or write, or research... yeah I have a lot of hobbies).
I joined Github to experiment with my ideas :) (though most of my projects are not even on GitHub for my own references)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a really bulky project that aims to help users. (Private right now)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning hardware coding (and moreso just upload them instead of keeping those to self) like WASM at the moment

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Go to a repo that's public and pull up an issue. :)

**NOTE: (Metrics below are not representative of skill. Rather, they're Github-based metrics, and most of the HTML/CSS origin from one project anyway.)**

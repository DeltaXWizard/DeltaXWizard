### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and thanks for reading!

In between studying, I code by day, and I game or take photos at night (or draw, or write, or research... yeah I have a lot of hobbies).
I joined Github to experiment with my ideas and to track some of them :)

Most of my coding projects are closed-source even beyond Git.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a really bulky project that aims to help users. (Private right now, but it will be released soon.)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python or Java/JS and/or generic discord bot development, I won't mind assisting.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Go to a repo that's public and pull up an issue. :) (Contact info releasing soon.)
